This Python project aims to provide users with real-time information about train schedules and seat availability in India. By leveraging web scraping and API requests, it fetches data from the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website, allowing users to input a train number, boarding station, and journey date to retrieve relevant details such as train name, stations en route, and available seats by class. This tool enhances the travel planning experience for passengers by offering convenient access to essential information for making informed decisions regarding their train journeys.
